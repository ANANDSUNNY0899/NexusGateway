##  Overview

**Nexus Gateway** is an intelligent middleware designed to sit between your users and Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI. It solves the three biggest problems in AI Engineering today: **Cost, Latency, and Scalability.**

By using **Vector Embeddings (OpenAI text-embedding-3)** and **Cosine Similarity Search**, Nexus understands the *context* of a user's question. If a similar question has been asked before, it serves the cached response instantly from **Pinecone/Redis**, bypassing the expensive LLM call entirely.

---

##  Key Features

###  Performance & Cost
- **Semantic Caching:** Recognizes that "How do I make tea?" and "Recipe for tea" are the same question. Serves cached answers in **<50ms**.
- **Multi-Layer Storage:** Hot cache in **Redis** (L1) and Vector storage in **Pinecone** (L2).
- **Cost Reduction:** Proven to reduce OpenAI token usage by up to **90%** for repetitive workloads.

###  Security & Scalability
- **Rate Limiting:** Token-bucket algorithm (Redis) to prevent abuse (e.g., 100 requests/limit).
- **Multi-Tenant Auth:** Secure user management via **Supabase (PostgreSQL)**. Users generate their own `nk-` API keys.
- **Stateless Architecture:** Fully containerized Go binary deployed on **Render Cloud**.

###  Monetization (SaaS Ready)
- **Automated Billing:** Integrated **Stripe Checkout** for plan upgrades.
- **Webhooks:** Real-time account upgrades via Stripe Webhooks.
- **Usage Tracking:** Tracks every token and request per user.

# Getting Started
Prerequisites
Go 1.21+
Redis Instance (Upstash/Local)
PostgreSQL (Supabase/Local)
API Keys (OpenAI, Pinecone, Stripe)

## Installation
1. Clone the Repo

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/ANANDSUNNY0899/NexusGateway.git
cd NexusGateway
```
#  You can install the official client via pip:

```Bash
pip install nexus-gateway
```
# Setup Environment
    ## Create a .env file or set variables in your terminal:

    export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
    export REDIS_URL="rediss://..."
    export PINECONE_API_KEY="pcsk_..."
    export PINECONE_HOST="index-name.svc.pinecone.io"
    export DB_URL="postgresql://..."
    export STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_..."

```
3. Run the Server: go run main.go
```

4. API Endpoints
    * Method	Endpoint	Description	Auth Required
    * POST	/api/register	Create a new user & get API Key	❌ No
    * POST	/api/chat	Send prompt to AI (Cached)	✅ Yes
    * POST	/api/checkout	Generate Stripe Payment Link	✅ Yes
    * GET	/api/stats	View global savings stats	❌ No

##  Completed Roadmap

- [x] **Multi-Model Support:** Universal Router architecture supporting OpenAI (GPT-4) and Anthropic (Claude 3).
- [x] **Dashboard V2:** Real-time visual analytics charts for traffic and cost monitoring.
- [x] **SDK:** Official Python wrapper published on PyPI (`pip install nexus-gateway`).
- [x] **Monetization:** Stripe integration with automated quota management.

##  What's Next?

- [ ] **Node.js SDK:** TypeScript wrapper for JS environments.
- [ ] **Team Accounts:** Organization-level billing and API key management.
- [ ] **Advanced Logging:** Searchable history of all past requests and responses.
